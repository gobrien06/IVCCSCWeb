We are starting up preparation for our hackathon again (that hopefully doesn't get cancelled on us)  and we will be giving more details on it as we set them in stone. Additionally, we will be starting meetings up again in a couple of weeks once everyone is more set in their schedules. We will likely also be reducing the amount of weekly meetings to one during the school week and one every other Friday (aside from the project groups) in order to leave more time for workshop/project work. We still have plenty more in the works for you guys and we hope you have a smooth start to the school year!"
